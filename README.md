## ðŸŽ¯ Current Focus: HTML & CSS Fundamentals

My current learning journey is centered around building a strong foundation in:

* **Layouts:** Flexbox, Grid, and traditional block/inline models.
* **Styling:** Colors, typography, backgrounds, borders, and shadows.
* **Responsiveness:** Making websites look great on all devices.
* **Interactivity (CSS-only):** Hover effects, transitions, and animations.
* **Specific Properties:** Deep dives into `position`, `overflow`, `filter`, and `border-style`.

## ðŸ“‚ Repository Structure

To keep things organized without using folders, I follow a simple file-naming convention. Each practice task is identified by its purpose in the file name:

* **`[task-name].html`** for the HTML file.
* **`[task-name].css`** for the associated CSS file.

This makes it easy to find specific practice exercises directly in the repository's root directory.

## ðŸ’¡ Why This Repository?

* **Tracking Progress:** A clear timeline of my learning journey.
* **Self-Assessment:** A way to review concepts and identify areas for improvement.
* **Demonstration:** A live portfolio of my foundational skills for potential collaborators or employers.
